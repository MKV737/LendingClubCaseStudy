## General Information
- In this project we will be working on loan data set.
- Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
1. Risk Assessment and Borrower Profiles:
   - Borrowers with higher annual incomes are generally more creditworthy and have a better repayment capacity.
   - Loan grades play a significant role in predicting loan default. Borrowers with higher-grade loans tend to have better repayment behavior.

2. Loan Amount and Default Behavior:
   - Smaller loan amounts have a higher likelihood of being fully paid, while larger loan amounts are associated with a higher risk of default.

3. Interest Rates and Repayment:
   - Interest rates impact loan repayment behavior. Lower interest rates are correlated with higher rates of full repayment.

4. Loan Purpose and Default Rates:
   - Certain loan purposes, such as small business and renewable energy, have higher default rates. Understanding the relationship between loan purpose and repayment behavior can inform risk assessment strategies.

5. Loan Term Impact:
   - Long-term loans are more likely to result in defaults compared to short-term loans. This suggests that customers may face challenges repaying loans over extended periods.

6. Grade-Based Strategies:
   - A careful assessment of borrower grades is crucial. Lower-grade loans should undergo rigorous evaluation, and risk management strategies should be adapted accordingly.

7. Customer Segmentation:
   - Using attributes like annual income and loan grade, customers can be segmented into risk profiles. This allows for tailored loan offerings and more effective risk assessment.
